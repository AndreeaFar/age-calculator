## Overview

The objective of this project was to create a user-friendly age calculator app. The primary functionality is to request users to input their birthdate and, once submitted, it showcases their age in years, months, and days. It offers real-time feedback through visual cues and error messages, ensuring the data inputted by users is accurate.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:

  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
